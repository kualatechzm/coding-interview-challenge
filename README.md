# Interview Coding Challenge

This is the first step in the interview process. Follow the instructions below to complete this portion of the interview. Please note, although a hard time limit is not set to complete this challnge, we recommend completing it as soon as possible as we evaluate candidates on a first come, first serve basis.

## Pre-requisites

1. A text editor: we recommend Visual Studio code (<https://code.visualstudio.com>)
2. You may need the Go programming language installed on your computer for the technical assessment, depending on the task you choose (<https://go.dev/dl>)
3. Docker: for building and running containers for the technical assessment

    * You can install the Docker Desktop - <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker>
    * Or, the Docker Engine - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install>
    * If you're a Linux or WSL user, please take note of [these post-installtion steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall) if you decide to use the Docker Engine
    * If you're using a Windows machine, please take note of the note at the bottom.

4. Git: for source control and committing your final solution to a new private repo (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
  
    * If you're not very familiar with Git commands, here's a helpful cheatsheet (<https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf>)

## Instructions

* Clone this repo locally using git clone
* Attempt any of the tasks in [`01-technical-assessment`](/01-technical-assessment.md)
* Attempt the task in [`02-case-study`](/02-case-study.md)

Once the challenge is complete, please push the code to a new private repo and grant access to the following usernames/email addresses for code review

    stctheproducer or dev@stctheproducer.com
    k9uma or kuma.musenge@gmail.com

## Submission

***Fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/SdLanzCwXv) so that we can be notified about your submission***

## A Note on Expected Duration

Whichever task you choose in the [technical assessment](/01-technical-assessment.md), we don't expect you to spend more than a couple
of hours on your solution: it should fit comfortably into one evening, so please
don't spend a week refactoring your code!

## A Note for Windows Users

Installing Docker Desktop is a little more involving on Windows as it requires the
use of the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) backend as well as some virtualisation features
to be enabled in the BIOS. The
[docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) are helpful but you
may prefer to set up a Linux virtual machine on your computer (e.g. using VirtualBox),
or use a [free AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/free) instead.

We look forward to receiving your submission.

Good Luck! üëçüèæ
